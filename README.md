# Welcome to the scrollytellr app

This repository contains a shiny app that can create Quarto Closeread scrollytelling webpages 

A tutorial for how to use the app is here:  https://emeyers.github.io/scrollytellr/tutorial/tutorial.html

An example of the running app is on shinyapps.io at: https://ethan-meyers-test.shinyapps.io/scrollytellr/  (note, it runs rather slowly here) 

Overall this is still a work in progress so if you have any additional ideas how to improve the app let me know and/or submit a pull request
